## Featured Projects
Here are a few selected projects that showcase my interests in software development, research, and problem-solving.

### 1. [Grant Budget Management System](https://grant-budget-management-system.onrender.com/login.php)  
The **Grant Budget Management System (GBMS)** is a web-based application designed to assist researchers, administrators, and grant managers in creating and managing grant budgets. The system streamlines the budgeting process, tracks personnel costs, and calculates direct and indirect costs efficiently.

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=000000)
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Running-brightgreen)

> **Key Features**:  
> - User Authentication: Secure login and registration system.
> - Create and manage grant budgets.
> - Assign roles to team members (PI, Co-PI, etc.).
> - Calculate yearly and total costs dynamically.
> - Integrate fringe and indirect cost calculations.
> - Excel Export: Download grant budgets as well-formatted Excel sheets.
> - Responsive Design: Accessible on desktop and mobile devices.


### 2. Antivirus Deployment System
A machine-learning-powered system for predicting virus transmission dynamics and determining optimal antivirus deployment locations. Utilizes the **SEIR epidemiological framework** with **Python** for visualization. Proprietary Notice: This project was developed under contract for University of Idaho.

> **Key Features**:  
> - Machine learning for virus prediction  
> - SEIR framework for epidemiological modeling  
> - Visualized using Matplotlib  
> - Predicts optimal locations for antivirus deployment


### 3. [Automata Studio](https://dristanta-silwal.github.io/automata-studio/)  
Automata Studio is a web-based tool designed for building and visualizing automata. It enables students and researchers to explore concepts from the Theory of Computation through interactive diagrams and simulations.

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?style=flat&logo=react&logoColor=000000) 
![Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Vite-61DAFB?style=flat&logo=vite&logoColor=000000) 
![Tailwind](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TailwindCSS-38B2AC?style=flat&logo=tailwindcss&logoColor=ffffff) 
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Running-brightgreen)

> **Key Features**:  
> - Build and visualize DFA, NFA, PDA, and Turing Machines  
> - Step-by-step simulation with Instantaneous Descriptions (IDs)  
> - Convert NFA to DFA using subset construction  
> - Graphical editor for states and transitions  
> - Import/Export automata in JSON and JFLAP (.jff) formats  
> - Undo/Redo functionality and autosave via local storage  
> - Live validation warnings (missing start state, no accepting states, undefined symbols, unreachable states, DFA nondeterminism)  


### 4. [DebateBot](https://dristanta-silwal.github.io/AI-debateBot/)  
DebateBot is a full-stack proof-of-concept application that enables turn-based debates between a human user and an AI (powered by Gemini).  
The backend is built with **FastAPI**, and the frontend is a static **HTML + TailwindCSS** interface.

![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/-FastAPI-009688?style=flat&logo=fastapi&logoColor=ffffff)
![Pydantic](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pydantic-E92063?style=flat&logo=pydantic&logoColor=ffffff)
![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TailwindCSS-38B2AC?style=flat&logo=tailwindcss&logoColor=ffffff)
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Running-brightgreen)

> **Key Features**:
> - Start a debate by specifying a topic and choosing the AI's side (PRO or CON).  
> - Structured, turn-based exchanges with word-count validation (120–180 words per turn).  
> - AI persona enforced with clear debate rules (formal, professional, respectful tone).  
> - Supports switching debate sides mid-session ([SWITCH] keyword).  
> - Graceful error handling, retry logic, and daily user message limits.  
> - Deployed using Render (backend) and GitHub Pages (frontend).
